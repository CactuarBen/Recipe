        <h1>The Castella cake</h1>
        <h2>Kasutera, Castella, カステラ, Honey Cake</h2>
        <p>This Japanese sponge cake is made with just flour, eggs, sugar, and a sugary syrup, such as honey, which also flavors the sponge. Today, castella can have a myriad of different flavors, such as matcha, chocolate, and brown sugar, but in Taiwan and some other South Asian countries like Singapore, a cheese castella cake is very popular. To prepare, eggs are first whisked with sugar to a ribbon stage, and the honey is stirred in next, followed by flour which is gently folded in. The prepared batter is poured into, traditionally, a wooden frame, and baked up to 50 minutes. If baked to perfection, kasutera should be moist, light, and with a very fine texture. There are two main preparation methods, the traditional one where eggs are beaten in a double boiler and the one where eggs are not beaten in a double boiler. There is also a third, less common, method where yolks and egg whites are first whisked separately and then combined. Most recipes today also include additional ingredients such as milk or water, and even mirin and rice wine. Popular variations of this cake, baby and suzu castella, are small, either round or bell-shaped and are sold at festivals from yatai food stalls. Before serving, the sides of the cake are cut off, revealing the yellow insides, and the cake is then cut into thick slices. Kasutera is usually served as a snack (oyatsu) and goes perfectly with unsweetened green, or toasted barley (mugicha) tea.</p>

        <h3>Steps to make Castella</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="step">Set the oven to preheat to 170°C, or 150°C if using a convection oven.</li>
            <li class="step">First, coat the bottom and the sides of a baking pan (30cm long X 10cm wide) with butter or shortening, then line it with baking paper, so that a portion of the paper is hanging over the sides of the pan. Sprinkle the bottom of the pan with sugar.</li>
            <li class="step">Bring a pot of water to a boil, then remove from the heat.</li>
            <li class="step">Whisk milk and honey together (heat in the microwave shortly if unable to mix), and double sift the flour.</li>
            <li class="step">Position a bowl over a pan with hot water, then add the eggs and the sugar to the bowl. Whisk with an electric mixer set at the lowest speed until lukewarm to touch. Take the bowl off the pan with water, and continue whisking. If at any moment the mixture turns cold, place the bowl back on the pan with hot water and whisk until lukewarm. The batter is done when it is so thick that when you draw the whisk up, soft peaks are formed.</li>
            <li class="step">Next, whisk in the milk and honey mixture, then add flour tablespoon by tablespoon, whisking all the time until incorporated.</li>
            <li class="step">When the cake is cool enough to handle, put the cake (with the baking paper on) into a plastic bag and seal. Refrigerate for a few hours.</li>
            <li class="step">When ready to serve, first, slice off the edges of the cake, then cut into neat slices.</li>
        </ol>
