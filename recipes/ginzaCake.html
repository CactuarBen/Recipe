        <h1>Ginza Cake (Mushi pan)</h1>
        <h2>(Mushi-pan, Mushipan, 蒸しパン, Steamed Bread, Steamed Cake)</h2>
        <p>Characterized by their soft and light texture, mushi pan are Japanese steamed buns that come in a variety of flavors. They are prepared with a simple base that employs flour, sugar, baking powder, and eggs, and are traditionally steamed in small-sized molds, reminiscent those used to prepare muffins.</p>
        <p>The buns became popular after the Second World War when what flour became more common in Japanese households. Sweet potato (satsumaimo) was originally used as a sweetener instead of sugar, and this is still one of the most popular varieties of mushi pan, along with chocolate, banana, mango, matcha, azuki and many more.</p>

        <h3>Steps to make Ginza Cake</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="steps">Cover the lid with a kitchen towel to prevent condensation (please don’t skip!). Fill a large frying pan with water about ½ inch (1.3 cm) deep. Cover the pan with the lid and slowly bring water to a boil.</li>
            <li class="steps">Gather all the ingredients. You will also need 4 6-oz ramekins and cupcake liners.</li>
            <li class="steps">In a medium bowl, combine all-purpose flour and baking powder and whisk well to combine (shortcut for sifting).</li>
            <li class="steps">In a small bowl, whisk the egg, milk, sugar, and vegetable oil together until combined and sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li class="steps">Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and mix until just combined and smooth. Do not over mix.</li>
            <li class="steps">Put a cupcake liner in glass ramekins and divide the batter into the cupcake liners.</li>
            <li class="steps">Place the glass ramekins in the boiling water and cook covered on the lowest heat for 8 minutes.</li>
            <li class="steps">They're done when a skewer inserted comes out clean without wet batter. Turn off the heat and remove the ramekins from the pan and let them cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
