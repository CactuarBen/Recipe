        <h3>What is Melon Pan?</h3>
        <p>Melon Pan is sweet bread covered in a thin layer of crisp biscuit/cookie crust with grid line pattern on top. The Japanese word for bread is “pan (パン)”, which came from the Portuguese word for bread. Now why is it called “melon“.
            Does it taste like melon? No, traditionally the bread does NOT include melon flavor or the fruit itself. Then why is it called Melon Pan if there is no melon flavor?
            There are a few different theories for the origin of Melon Pan’s name (still no conclusive theory even today).
            Some say that the original melon pan was invented during the Meiji Era. The bread resembled an oriental melon (マクワウリ) with the parallel lines on the crust, and was filled with sweet white bean paste (shiro-an) inside. During that time, the oriental melon was sold as “melon” so they started to call this “Melon Pan”.</p>

        <h3>Steps to bake Melonpan</h3>
        <p>Step 1 - Making Main Dough</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="step">In a large bowl, combine 225 g (1 ¾ cup + 2 Tbsp) bread flour, 25 g (3 ½ Tbsp) cake flour, 40 g (3 Tbsp) granulated sugar, and 3 g (1 tsp) kosher salt.</li>
            <li class="step">Add 4 g (1 tsp) instant dry yeast and 1 large beaten egg to the bowl with dry ingredients.</li>
            <li class="step">Add 50 ml (3 ½ Tbsp) milk and 50 ml (3 ½ Tbsp) water, both at 86ºF (30ºC). Using a silicone spatula or your fingertips, gently mix the ingredients together until they are combined.</li>
            <li class="step">In the beginning, the dough is very sticky and wet, but keep mixing until it forms a loose, sticky ball. Also, use the dough to pick up the flour on the sides of the mixing bowl. This step should take about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough from the bowl to a lightly floured work surface.</li>
            <li class="step">Press the heels of your hands into the dough, pushing forward slightly. Fold the top half of the dough in half back toward you. Then rock forward on the lower part of your palm to press it flat.</li>
            <li class="step">Turn the dough slightly (to clockwise), fold it in half, and rock into it again with the lower part of your palm. Knead the dough to lengthen and stretch the gluten strands in the dough. Repeat for 5 minutes or so. Tip: If the dough doesn't seem to be losing its stickiness, sprinkle more flour over the top and work it into the dough. You can lightly dust your hands with flour to keep the dough from sticking too much.</li>
            <li class="step">After kneading for 5 minutes and the dough gets more elastic, press and stretch the dough, about 10 inches (25 cm). Then put small cubes of 35 g (2 ½ Tbsp) unsalted butter on top of the dough. Roll up the dough tucking the butter in, and then continue the kneading process.</li>
            <li class="step">As you knead, the dough will absorb the butter and it will eventually become very smooth and easier to work with. Finally, start banging the dough onto the work surface and fold it over away from you. This helps develop the gluten (elasticity). Bang the dough, turn it 90 degrees, and knead it, using the lower part of your palm. Continue this process for 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky. Tip: Don’t let go of the dough when you are banging onto the work surface and don’t let it rest for too long between turns.</li>
            <li class="step">When the dough gets silky and smooth, pull the end of your dough with your thumb and fingers. Keep spreading the dough with your fingers, stretching the dough into thin translucent membrane. This test is called Windowpane Test to see if the dough's gluten has been developed enough. If the dough tears, the gluten isn’t quite ready yet. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes and test again.</li>
            <li class="step">Shape the dough into a ball by pulling all sides of the ball to the bottom and pinching them together. Place the dough in a bowl (the seam on the bottom).</li>
            <li class="step">Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1-2 hours. I use a Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven.</li>
        </ol>
            <p>Step 2 - Making the Biscuit Dough</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="step">In a large bowl, add 60 g (About 4 Tbsp) unsalted butter and mix with the silicone spatula until it becomes smooth.</li>
            <li class="step">Add 100 g (½ cup) granulated sugar and mix with the silicone spatula until they blend well together.</li>
            <li class="step">Slowly add a very small amount of 1 large beaten egg (46-50 g/ml) into the bowl and blend well together before you add another small amount of the egg. Continue until all the egg is well blended.</li>
            <li class="step">Sift 200 g (1 ⅔ cup) cake flour and 2 g (½ tsp) baking powder into the mixture.</li>
            <li class="step">Using the silicone spatula, mix well until the dough is not floury. Collect the dough and make it into a ball.</li>
            <li class="step">Measure the weight of the biscuit dough. It should be around 400-410 g. Remember the weight as you’ll need it later (to measure ⅒ of the dough).</li>
            <li class="step">Roughly cut the dough into 10 pieces.</li>
        </ol>
            <p>Step 3 - Baking</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="step">Bake at for 13-15 minutes. Toward the end of baking if you see the bread is not being browning evenly, rotate the bread once so that the bread gets an even color.</li>
            <li class="step">Once the bread is baked, transfer to a wire rack. Let it cool for 5 minutes, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
